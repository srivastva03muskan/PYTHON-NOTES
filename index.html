  <h3> Brisc History  Of Python </h3>
  <p>Python is a widely used  general-purchase, high-level programming  languages. It was initially desined by Guido van Rossum in 1991and developed by python Software Foundation.It was mainly developed foremphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmer to expressconcepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1980, history was about to be written.It was that when working on Python Started. Soon after that,Guido Van Rossumbegan doing its application based  work in December of 1989 by at project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep  him occupied during Christmas.The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Languages. </p>

The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.

Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.
On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.
ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.
